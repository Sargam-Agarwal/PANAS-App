# PANAS APP

The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule or (PANAS) is a scale that consists of different words that describe feelings and emotions. One of these scales measures positive affect, and the other measures negative affect.

This PANAS App measures both positive and negative emotions for the users (on the basis of their responses) from week-to-week as they engage in everyday life. More the positive score, the better.
